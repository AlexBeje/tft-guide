    "description": "Currently the most popular comp, due to Taric and Invokers receiving considerable buffs in Patch 13.14. If you play this you are likely going to be very contested. You can take Bard as your Legend hope for the silver Augment 'Caretaker's Ally' that grants you several of the same Tier 3 unit. You have a good chance of hitting Taric, Lissandra or Karma which will help you a lot at stabilizing in the early mid game.<br><br>Overall the goal is to play 4 Invokers with Taric and pivot into 6 Invokers either with an Emblem or Shen. Give Taric your tank items and Karma your AP items. You can run Soraka Carry if you managed to find her 3 Star, otherwise you can simply give her Chalice, especially when running Twisted Fate Legend. Should be Level 6 in Stage 3-2 and Level 7 in early Stage to add Ionia with Sett.<br><br>Since you are likely too contested to properly hit 3 Star units you can rush for Level 8 after finding your core setup at Level 6/7 and add Ryze and Ahri as a late game win condition."

With three 3 Star units Poppy will transform into 4 Star and acts as an amazing tank throughout the entire game.<br><br>It's helpful if your economy is not completely ruined by the roll down since this comp does intend to push towards Level 8 and even Level 9 and cap out the board with Heimerdinger, Aatrox and vertical Slayers.<br><br>Main item focus is on Kayle with Guinsoo/Gunblade/Giant Slayer. Poppy takes tank items like Bramble, Protector's Vow and Dragon's Claw. Depending on which items you find you can be flexible whether Kayle or Poppy receives the Radiant Item from the Demacia Trait."

From here you can either stay on Level 7, roll for Akshan*3 and then push Level 8 or you go straight for Level 8 and roll for Akshan*3 later. Both are viable, it somewhat depends how many Akshan you find and if you have Augments that help with rolling.<br><br>    In late game you can add Sion for an additional Frontline and Heimerdinger for utility.
